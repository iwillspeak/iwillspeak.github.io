A quick and easy recipe for the flapjack I miss from the office.

## Ingredients

 * Porridge oats: 250 grams
 * Strawberry Granola: 10 grams
 * Cake Fruit: 30 grams
 * Pumpkin Seeds: 10 grams
 * Butter (melted): 150 grams
 * Sugar: 150 grams
 * Golden Syrup: 2 tbsp
 
## Method

Pre-heat the oven to 180C (fan). Line a baking tray with greaseproof
paper.

Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl and set aside.

Place the butter and sugar into a microwaveable jug. Microwave the
mixture for bursts of 30 seconds and stir until the butter has melted
and combined with the sugar.

Pour the hot sugar/butter mixture into the dry ingredients. Add the
golden syrup and combine well.

Tip out onto the baking tray and firm down with the back of a spoon or
spatula until evenly distributed.

Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown on top.

Leave to stand for 10 minutes before dividing into portions.
