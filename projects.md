# My Projects

I have many projects on the go at [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak) and [Github](http://github.com/iwillspeak); most of them are just for fun. Here are some of the jewels in the crown:

* [Snooper](http://github.com/iwillspeak/snooper) - for all your test automation needs.
* [Thunker](https://vimeo.com/66365606) - Home automation at its finest.
