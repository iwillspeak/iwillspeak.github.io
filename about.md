# About {{ site.name }}

<img class="avatar" src="img/avatar.jpg" alt="My face" title="It is my face, but from 10+ years ago. I may or may not have a beard now." />

{{ site.name }} is the various projects and musings of me, Will Speak. I am a Computer Science graduate and software engineer. I have dabbled in a variety of programming languages. When it comes to user interfaces Iâ€™d rather have a command line. I have an interest in [digital paiting][deviant], [photography][flickr], cycling, and wrenching on bikes.

You can usually find me messing around with some form of software or another, and this has lead to the creation of many [projects](/projects.html). I sometimes livestream development [on Twitch][twitch]. When I have the time, or feel the need, I like to post my thoughts on my [Blog][blog].

You can follow me on Twitter as [@willspeak][twitter]. Don't expect me
to tell you anything more interesting than the coffee i'm drinking
though. As well as my Deviant Art you can find more polished pieces on [my Instagram][instagram].

## Why Plingdollar?

It is a UNIX thing. It is a shell thing. It is what I say in my head every time I type `!$`, my second favourite shell command after `!!` (or possibly `sudo !!`).
