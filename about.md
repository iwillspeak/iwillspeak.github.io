# About {{ site.name }}

<div>
<p style="float: left; width: 600px;">
{{ site.name }} is the various projects and musings of me, Will Speak. I am a computer science graduate and software developer. I have dabbled in a variety of programming languages. When it comes to user interfaces Iâ€™d rather have a command line. I have an interest in
<a href="{{ site.deviant_url }}">digital paiting</a>, <a href="{{ site.flickr_url }}" alt="My Flickr Site">photography</a>, and a weakness for all things mac.

You can usually find me messing around with some form of software or another, and this has lead to the creation of many [projects](/projects.html). When I have the time, or feel the need, I like to post my thoughts on my [Blog][blog].

You can follow me on Twitter as [@willspeak][twitter]. Don't expect me
to tell you anything more interesting than the coffee i'm drinking
though. As well as my Deviant Art you can find more polished pieces on [my Instagram][instagram].

## Why Plingdollar?

It is a UNIX thing. It is a shell thing. It is what I say in my head every time I type `!$`, my second favourite shell command after `!!` (or possibly `sudo !!`).
